# About The Mod

Quick ability switcher for Haste

Use your controller D-PAD to switch to the desired unlocked ability (That's right, the mod does not unlock the ability for you, switch happen if the ability is already unlocked)

# Usage

The game doesn't have an official modding support (for now!), we use [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) as the game patcher as an alternative:

- Follow the official installation guide [here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) and use this prelease when downloading [v6.0.0-pre2](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.2) (The file you want is _BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip_)
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Fcornaire/HBWAbilitySwitcher/releases/latest) and extract to your {game_path}/BepInEx/plugins
- Launch the game and check if the mod is working as intended (use your controller D-PAD)
